## OpenPipe with a barometric sensor

Building an electronic bagpipe trainer with [OpenPipe](http://openpipe.cc/) chanter and a [barometric sensor](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/bmp180-barometric-pressure-sensor-hookup-/installing-the-arduino-library) 
in a real bagpipe bag. So we are able to study fingering as well as "tempero"...

The objective is, as in a real instrument, start sound with bag pressure, and stop without it.
